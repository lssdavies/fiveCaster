## Description

fiveCaster is your personal online weather dashboard. It allows the user to search the current weather conditions of any city and get a 5 day forecast for that location. Perfect for all the world travellers.

I was motivated to build this app to provide travellers like myself the ability to check the current weather conditions for any city in the world so they can plan their travel arrangements accordingly.

The application uses api calls to fetch weather conditions using the OpenWeather One Call API.
